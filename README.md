# Microsoft-Movie-Studio-Analysis

Author: Cynthia Sophie Wangui Mwangi
## Overview
This project analyses the movie details from data provided by IDMB with the aim of deriving insights on the best rated, most liked and most profitable movie genres.
Three datasets were provided. They were then successfully merged. Descriptive Analysis of the recordings have been done and they show that Drama filled movies are most liked and generate the most revenue. Microsoft can hence use this analysis to understand which genre of movies they can best invest in.

## Data
Three datasets were provided. One cointained the titles of the movies and the number of votes each movie had. The second dataset contained the ratings of the movies while the final dataset contained the revenue generated from the movies. The datasets were merged using common column names. The first two had unique movie IDs while the second and third datasets had the common column "title". 

## Methods
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed on the data. Descriptive analysis alongside graphic representations of the nature of this data was done. This produced desired insights on the best genres of Movies with the best return on investments.

## Results
The graph below represents distribution of the annual releases of Movies

# Conclusion
This analysis leads to three recommendations for the success of Microsoft Movie Venture;
- ** The team should ensure they venture into Drama Movies. These are more liked by viewers and generate the most income 
- ** From the analysis, it can be concluded that people enjoy movies that are around one and a half to two hours. This then means that they should focus on making movies that are within this length.
- ** Most movies that already exist are Drama Movies. This thus means there will be a lot of competition. To make them more relevant in the movie industry, they should try incorporate comedy in their Drama movies, as comedy was rated the second best genre.

# Next Steps
- ** Further analysis can be done to derive more insights. For instance, analysis on the actors and actresses that are rated highly or liked by the viewers. This will help them understand the type of actors to recruit when making the movie.
- ** It is also encouraged to venture into analysis of independent movies to understand their setting, for example movies in a certain country or location (vacation based for instance). This would help them understand more of what people would like to see.
- ** Insights on different age groups and the movies the enjoy could also be helpful. This will help in diversifying and ultimately increase revenue.
